These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their   eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person   with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than   1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."],
